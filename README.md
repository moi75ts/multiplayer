# Starsector campaign Multiplayer Mod

## Description

This is an experimental multiplayer mod for *Starsector*, built using a client-server architecture. The server maintains the definitive game world state, and clients can update the server through their actions, synchronizing changes across all connected clients.

This is my first attempt at Java programming and game modding, so expect bugs and rough edges. I created this mod primarily as a proof of concept. Updates may be infrequent, but you are welcome to fork or contribute to the project.

## Prerequisites

This is a standalone mod requiring no additional mods or libraries.

**Important**: When connecting to a server, the game seed must match. If you start a new game with `devmode` enabled, map generation ignores the seed. **Do not start a new game with devmode enabled.**

## How to Create or Join a Game

Upon launching the game, a separate window will appear:

In this window, you can:
- Set the IP address to connect to.
- Choose a username, which will be displayed above your fleet.
- Start a server by clicking "Connect" in server mode.

To join a game as a client, the following must match:
- Game version
- Mod list
- Game seed

If you don't know the seed, attempting to connect will display the correct seed. You can copy it using the "Copy" button in the UI:

- Drop cargo pods for other players to pick up:

### What Doesn't Work (Yet)
- No combat.
- No AI fleets.
- No missions.
- Games must start with the same seed (future updates may remove this requirement).
- Fleet position rubberbanding due to acceleration issues.

## Troubleshooting

- **Planets are misaligned**: Try pausing and unpausing the game.
- **Disconnected from server**: Check the UI to confirm your connection status.
- **Other player's fleet is invisible or disappears**: Modify your fleet composition or order.
